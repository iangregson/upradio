UpRadio - or Universal Public Radio to use its full name - is an application that runs in your web browser and allows you to broadcast or listen to live audio streams to anyone on the internet. The audio is streamed peer-to-peer using WebRTC (with big thanks to [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/)).

The vision for the future of this project is much larger... but I'm still working on distilling that down to something I can write in a couple of paragraphs.
