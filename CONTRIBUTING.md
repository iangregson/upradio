# Contributing to UpRadio

This project is very much in its infancy, so there's not much in the way of guidelines here. But contributions are welcome.

### How to get started

Check the project [Issues](https://github.com/iangregson/upradio/issues) and [Kanban](https://github.com/iangregson/upradio/projects/1) and pick something to work on. Say hello in the [matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/!tabwwSGkCTKBdIJgVw:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) and talk about what you're working on.

### Bugs

File bugs in the [Issues](https://github.com/iangregson/upradio/issues) area. Include the following information:

* Browser (including version number)
* Device (including make, model and OS)
* What were you doing?
* What did you expect?
* What actually happened?

Screenshots are good. Videos are better.

### Can I use React or <insert other framework here>?

Not right now. TypeScript, HTML and CSS are the tools we have for the moment. One day that might be different, but that's where I'm at right now.
